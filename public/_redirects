# Cloudflare Pages SPA fallback routing
# Handles client-side routing for React Router

# Main app (emuy.gg) - all routes fallback to index.html
# https://emuy.gg/* /index.html 200

# Events app (ironforged-events.emuy.gg) - all routes fallback to events.html
# This is handled by Cloudflare Pages custom domain routing

# SPA fallback - serves index.html for any unmatched routes
# Static files are served automatically before this rule applies
/*    /index.html   200!

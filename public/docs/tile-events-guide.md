## What Are Tile Events?

Tile events are progression-based challenges where you complete tasks (tiles) in sequence. Each tile represents a specific challenge - typically a boss kill, skilling milestone, or other in-game achievement.

## Getting Started

### 1. Joining an Event

1. Navigate to the **Events** page
2. Browse available events and click on one to view details
3. Once you're viewing an event, you'll see a game board with numbered tiles
4. Your current tile is highlighted - this is where you need to submit proof

### 2. Understanding the Board

| Tile Color | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| 🟢 **Green** | Completed - You've finished this tile |
| 🟡 **Yellow** | Current - This is your active tile |
| ⚫ **Gray** | Locked - Complete previous tiles to unlock |

**Connection Lines:**
- 🟢 **Green line** - Previous tile fully approved
- 🟡 **Amber line** - Previous tile submitted, awaiting approval
- ⚫ **Gray dashed line** - Tile still locked

## Submitting Proof

### Step 1: Take a Screenshot

When you complete a task:
1. Take a clear screenshot showing the completion
2. Make sure any relevant text (KC, loot, etc.) is visible
3. Include your RuneScape name in the screenshot if possible

### Step 2: Upload Your Proof

1. Click on your **current tile** (highlighted in yellow)
2. Click the **"Upload Screenshot"** button
3. Select your screenshot file
4. Wait for the upload to complete

### Step 3: Wait for Processing

After uploading:
- **Auto-approved**: If the system recognizes your proof, the tile turns green immediately
- **Pending review**: If manual review is needed, you'll see a yellow "Pending" status

> **Tip:** Include keywords mentioned in the tile description for faster auto-approval!

## Multi-Submission Tiles

Some tiles require **multiple completions** (e.g., "Kill Boss X 3 times").

- The tile will show progress like "1/3 submitted"
- Keep submitting until you reach the required count
- The next tile unlocks once you've submitted enough proof

---

## Skips

Depending on the event, you may earn **skips** at milestone tiles:
- Tile 6: +1 skip
- Tile 12: +2 skips
- Tile 18: +3 skips

**Using a Skip:**
1. Click on your current tile
2. If you have skips available, you'll see a **"Skip This Tile"** button
3. Confirm to use one skip and move to the next tile

> **Note:** Skips are valuable - save them for difficult tiles!

---

## Rewards: Ingots

As you progress, you earn **ingots** (in-game currency/points):
- Tile 6: 50,000 ingots
- Tile 12: 100,000 more (150k total)
- Tile 18: 150,000 more (300k total)

Track your total ingots earned in the stats bar above the game board.

## Tips for Success

1. **Read tile descriptions carefully** - They often contain keywords for auto-approval
2. **Take clear screenshots** - Blurry or cropped images may be rejected
3. **Include your RSN** - Helps verify the submission is yours
4. **Save skips wisely** - Use them on tiles you truly can't complete
5. **Check back regularly** - Pending submissions are usually reviewed within 24 hours

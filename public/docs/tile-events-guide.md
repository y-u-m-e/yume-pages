# Game Specifics

## Understanding the Game Board

### Tile Colors

| Color | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 🟢 **Green** | Completed | No action needed |
| 🔵 **Pulsing Blue**| Current Tile | Submit proof here! |
| 🟡 **Yellow/Orange**| Pending Review | Waiting for approval |
| ⚫ **Gray** | Locked | Complete previous tiles first |

### Connection Lines

The lines between tiles show your progress:
- **Green solid line** → Previous tile fully approved
- **Amber solid line** → Previous tile submitted, awaiting approval  
- **Gray dashed line** → Path to locked tiles

---

## Submitting Proof

### What Makes Good Proof?

✅ **Do Include:**
- Clear, full screenshot of completion
- Visible loot via popup or via chatlog
- Your RuneScape name visible in the screenshot
- The Clan Event passphrase either via the plugin or in the chatbox (only if on mobile)

❌ **Do Not Submit if:**
- Blurry or cropped screenshots
- Screenshots from the wiki or other sources
- Screenshots without your RSN visible

### How to Submit

1. **Click your current tile** (highlighted in yellow/orange)
2. **Click "Upload Screenshot"** in the modal
3. **Select your image file** (PNG, JPG supported)
4. **Wait for processing** - the AI will analyze your screenshot

### After Submitting

- **Auto-Approved** ✅ → Tile turns green, next tile unlocks
- **Pending Review** ⏳ → An admin will review within 24 hours
- **Rejected** ❌ → You'll need to resubmit with better proof
    - At the top of your board, you will see a note if the submission was rejected
    - EX: ![Rejection Example Image](https://emuy.gg/images/markdown_assets/rejection_example.png)

---

## Multi-Submission Tiles

Some tiles require **multiple completions** (e.g., "Get GWD 2 drops times").

- Progress shows as "1/2 submitted", "2/2 submitted", etc.
- Keep submitting until you reach the required count
- The next tile unlocks once you've submitted all required proofs
- You don't need to wait for approval to continue submitting

---

## Skips

You start with a tile skip and at the 10 tile milestone, you earn another **skip** for a total of **2** skips earned throughout the event. Skips let you bypass difficult tiles:

| Milestone | Skips Earned |
|-----------|--------------|
| Start | +1 skip |
| Tile 10 | +1 skip |

### Using a Skip

1. Click your current tile
2. If you have skips available, you'll see **"⏭️ Skip This Tile"**
3. Click to use one skip and move to the next tile

> **Strategy:** Save skips for tiles you truly can't complete. Some bosses might not be doable for you, you might have already green logged them, or they could just not be putting out.

---

## Ingots (Rewards)

As you progress, you earn **ingots** - the event currency:

| Milestone | Ingots Earned | Total |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Tile 6 | 50,000 | 50k |
| Tile 12 | 100,000 | 150k |
| Tile 18 | 150,000 | 300k |

Track your ingots in the stats bar above the game board. Ingots can be redeemed for clan rewards!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "Why is my submission pending?"

The AI couldn't auto-verify your screenshot. This happens when:
- Text isn't clearly readable
- The screenshot doesn't contain expected keywords
- It's an uncommon format or layout
- The AI is just dumb and parsing it incorrectly

Don't worry - an admin will review it manually and reach out if there are any issues.

### "Can I redo a rejected submission?"

Yes! Simply click on the tile and submit a new screenshot. Make sure to address the rejection reason.

### "What if I complete a tile but forget to screenshot?"

Unfortunately, proof must be submitted at the time of completion. Always screenshot your achievements!

### "My board is in a weird state, I can't get a hold off anyone, and I dont know if I should move onto the next tile or not"

The entire board is viewable off the rip for this very reason! If some weird shennanigans is happening, submit a ticket or reachout, and  continue onward to the next tile. Someone will get with you to sort everything out at their earliest conveince.

### "How do I check my overall progress?"

The stats bar above the game board shows:
- Current tile position
- Available skips
- Total ingots earned

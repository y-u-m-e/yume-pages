# Game Specifics

## Understanding the Game Board

### Tile Colors

| Color | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 🟢 **Green** | Completed | No action needed |
| 🟢 **Pulsing Green**| Current Tile | Submit proof here! |
| 🟡 **Yellow/Orange**| Pending Review | Waiting for approval |
| ⚫ **Gray** | Locked | Complete previous tiles first |

### Connection Lines

The lines between tiles show your progress:
- **Green solid line** → Previous tile fully approved
- **Amber solid line** → Previous tile submitted, awaiting approval  
- **Gray dashed line** → Path to locked tiles

---

## Submitting Proof

### What Makes Good Proof?

✅ **Do Include:**
- Clear, full screenshot of completion
- Visible kill count (KC), loot, or achievement popup
- Your RuneScape name visible in the screenshot
- Any keywords mentioned in the tile description

❌ **Avoid:**
- Blurry or cropped screenshots
- Screenshots from the wiki or other sources
- Screenshots without your RSN visible

### How to Submit

1. **Click your current tile** (highlighted in yellow/orange)
2. **Click "Upload Screenshot"** in the modal
3. **Select your image file** (PNG, JPG supported)
4. **Wait for processing** - the AI will analyze your screenshot

### After Submitting

- **Auto-Approved** ✅ → Tile turns green, next tile unlocks
- **Pending Review** ⏳ → An admin will review within 24 hours
- **Rejected** ❌ → You'll need to resubmit with better proof

> **Pro Tip:** Include keywords from the tile description in your screenshot for faster auto-approval!

---

## Multi-Submission Tiles

Some tiles require **multiple completions** (e.g., "Kill Zulrah 3 times").

- Progress shows as "1/3 submitted", "2/3 submitted", etc.
- Keep submitting until you reach the required count
- The next tile unlocks once you've submitted all required proofs
- You don't need to wait for approval to continue submitting

---

## Skips

At milestone tiles, you earn **skips** that let you bypass difficult tiles:

| Milestone | Skips Earned |
|-----------|--------------|
| Tile 6 | +1 skip |
| Tile 12 | +2 skips |
| Tile 18 | +3 skips |

### Using a Skip

1. Click your current tile
2. If you have skips available, you'll see **"⏭️ Skip This Tile"**
3. Click to use one skip and move to the next tile

> **Strategy:** Save skips for tiles you truly can't complete. Some boss requirements might be too difficult for your account build!

---

## Ingots (Rewards)

As you progress, you earn **ingots** - the event currency:

| Milestone | Ingots Earned | Total |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Tile 6 | 50,000 | 50k |
| Tile 12 | 100,000 | 150k |
| Tile 18 | 150,000 | 300k |

Track your ingots in the stats bar above the game board. Ingots can be redeemed for clan rewards!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "Why is my submission pending?"

The AI couldn't auto-verify your screenshot. This happens when:
- Text isn't clearly readable
- The screenshot doesn't contain expected keywords
- It's an uncommon format or layout

Don't worry - an admin will review it manually within 24 hours.

### "Can I redo a rejected submission?"

Yes! Simply click on the tile and submit a new screenshot. Make sure to address the rejection reason.

### "What if I complete a tile but forget to screenshot?"

Unfortunately, proof must be submitted at the time of completion. Always screenshot your achievements!

### "Can I participate in multiple events?"

Yes! Your progress is tracked separately for each event.

### "How do I check my overall progress?"

The stats bar above the game board shows:
- Current tile position
- Available skips
- Total ingots earned
